# KOSGE Berlin - Consolidated Authentication System

## ✅ **Implementation Complete: Option A - Netlify Identity Only**

The project has been successfully consolidated to use **only Netlify Identity** for all admin functions. This eliminates the security risk of hardcoded credentials and provides a single, secure authentication system.

## 🔧 **What Was Changed:**

### **1. Removed Custom Admin System**

- ❌ Deleted `docs/admin.html` (custom admin dashboard)
- ❌ Deleted `docs/js/admin_dashboard.js` (custom admin JavaScript)
- ❌ Deleted `netlify/functions/login.js` (custom login function)
- ❌ Removed hardcoded credentials from `netlify/functions/common.js`

### **2. Enhanced Netlify CMS**

- ✅ Extended `docs/admin/config.yml` to include:
  - **Banner Management**: Upload, organize, and manage banners
  - **Participant Viewing**: View and export participant data
- ✅ Added new collections for banners and participants

### **3. Updated Netlify Functions**

- ✅ Updated `netlify/functions/banners.js` to use Netlify Identity
- ✅ Updated `netlify/functions/participants.js` to use Netlify Identity
- ✅ Removed JWT/bcrypt dependencies (kept jsonwebtoken for token verification)
- ✅ Simplified `netlify/functions/common.js`

### **4. New Admin Dashboard**

- ✅ Created `docs/admin/dashboard.html` with Netlify Identity integration
- ✅ Modern UI with banner management and participant viewing
- ✅ Secure authentication via email invitation

## 🔐 **Security Improvements:**

### **Before (Security Risk):**

```javascript
// ❌ REMOVED - Hardcoded credentials
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = "kosge2024!";
```

### **After (Secure):**

- ✅ **Netlify Identity**: Email invitation → User creates password
- ✅ **No hardcoded credentials**: All authentication via Netlify
- ✅ **JWT token verification**: Proper token validation
- ✅ **Single login system**: One authentication method

## 📋 **Admin Access:**

### **Netlify CMS (Content Management)**

- **URL**: `https://kosge-berlin.de/admin/`
- **Purpose**: Edit website content, upload images
- **Authentication**: Email invitation → User creates password
- **Features**:
  - Edit website content
  - Upload and manage images
  - Manage banners
  - View participants

### **Admin Dashboard (Technical Functions)**

- **URL**: `https://kosge-berlin.de/admin/dashboard.html`
- **Purpose**: Banner management, participant data
- **Authentication**: Same Netlify Identity account
- **Features**:
  - Upload/delete banners
  - View participant data
  - Export CSV data

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps:**

### **1. Environment Variables**

Set these in your Netlify Dashboard:

```bash
NETLIFY_JWT_SECRET=[Get from Netlify Identity settings]
```

### **2. Netlify Identity Setup**

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Identity
2. Enable Identity service
3. Configure registration (invite-only recommended)
4. Get the JWT secret from Identity settings

### **3. Invite Admin Users**

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Identity → Users
2. Click "Invite users"
3. Enter admin email addresses
4. Users receive email invitations to set passwords

## 🔄 **API Endpoints:**

### **Banners API** (`/api/banners`)

- `GET`: List all banners (requires authentication)
- `POST`: Upload new banner (requires authentication)
- `DELETE /api/banners/{id}`: Delete banner (requires authentication)

### **Participants API** (`/api/participants`)

- `GET`: List all participants (requires authentication)
- `POST`: Add new participant (public endpoint)

## ✅ **Benefits Achieved:**

1. **🔒 Enhanced Security**: No hardcoded passwords
2. **🎯 Single Authentication**: One login system for all admin functions
3. **📧 Email Invitations**: Secure user onboarding
4. **🔄 Unified Interface**: All admin functions in Netlify CMS
5. **🚀 Simplified Maintenance**: Fewer authentication systems to manage

## 🎉 **Result:**

The project now has a **single, secure authentication system** using Netlify Identity. All admin functions are accessible through the same login, eliminating the security risk of hardcoded credentials while providing a better user experience.

**Status**: ✅ **CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE**
